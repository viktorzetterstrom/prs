# `prs`

A Go CLI tool to list GitHub pull requests and copy formatted PR info to your clipboard for Slack.

You can also slap on `--last-week` to show all PRs you've been part of for the last seven days. In case you, like me, forget what you did.

```bash
go install github.com/viktorzetterstrom/prs@latest
```
